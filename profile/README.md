## ManufacturingOpen :heart: Open Source

Welcome to our GitHub organization!

Our mission is to usher in a new era of open and accessible engineering and manufacturing engagement, education and resources.

We believe that the best engagement comes from practical, hands-on and interactive opportunities and projects.

We seek to accomplish this by:

:books: Publishing written and recorded educational content for beginners that complement advanced physical and virtual workshops.

:computer: Providing open-source alternatives for key, fundamental digital technologies for engineering and manufacturing.

:handshake: Supporting other professional engineering organizations and open-source efforts that overlap with our mission.

## ManufacturingOpen :heart: Open Source

Welcome to our GitHub organization!

Our mission is to usher in a new era of open and accessible engineering and manufacturing engagement, education and resources.

We believe that the best engagement comes from practical, hands-on and interactive opportunities and projects along with mutual support.

We seek to accomplish this by:

:books: **Publishing written and recorded educational content for beginners that complement physical and virtual workshops.**

:computer: **Providing open-source alternatives for key, fundamental digital technologies for engineering and manufacturing.**

:classical_building: **Develop freely-accessible, open technical standards that compete with International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards.**

:handshake: **Supporting other professional engineering organizations and open-source efforts that overlap with our mission.**

## Code of Conduct

ManufacturingOpen sees value in everyone and we hope to build a welcoming community to contribute, share and grow.

Please review our current [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/MfgOpen/code-of-conduct).
